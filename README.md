# Port-Scanner   [Day 1 â€“ Cybersecurity Automation Tools]

Write a Python script that scans open ports on a target IP

------------------------------
What I learnt:
------------------------------
socket module (network hacking basics)
IP addressing & port scanning logic
Python loops + error handling

Goal -> Scan a target (hostname/IP) for open ports

To Learn: 
- Python socket programming
- How TCP connection scanning works
- Port scanning automation (like a mini-Nmap)
- Error handling, user input, and modular code design

  ðŸ”§ Features:
- Scans **ports 1â€“1024**
- Uses TCP to check if a port is open
- Fast scanning with `timeout`
- Clean CLI interface

Line-by-Line Explanation
Line	            What it Does
import socket: 	  Brings in Python's low-level networking module
socket.socket(): 	Creates a new TCP socket
connect_ex():     Attempts to connect to the port
result == 0:     	Means port is open
settimeout(0.5): 	Prevents hanging on unresponsive ports
try/except: 	    Avoids crashes from network errors
